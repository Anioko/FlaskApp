        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>    
    <p>
      <strong>Why Teachera?</strong> We have created teachera.org to help people looking to learn anything cheaper by joining a private group class and thereby lowering the cost per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What type of classes are available?</strong> We do not place a restriction on classes types. It can be guitar classes or programming classes or MBA classes.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Classes not available?</strong> If the classes that you are interested in are not available, please fill out your profile and indicate those classes. We will arrange those classes for you if there are from three to five other people interested in such classes.
    </p>
     <p>
      <strong>What do the classes cost?</strong> Classes are calculated by the cost per hour. We do not place any restrictions on the cost of the classes but we are working to see that classes are as low as three euro depending on the type of courses and the number of people who are interested in that class.
    </p><p> A class that has five attendees should most likely be cheaper than a class that has only one attendee.</p>
     
    <p>
      <strong>How do I pay for the class?</strong> The teacher or tutor or coach is responsible to get the payment as cash at the beginning of the class. For classes that take a month, the fees should be paid monthly.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Found a class but not many attendees. What should I do?</strong> You can take the link to the class or course and share it with your friends on social media. This will increase the awareness and you can have an affordable class.
    </p><p>You can take the link to the class or course and share it with your friends on social media. This will increase the awareness and you can have an affordable class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interested to teach, how do I proceed?</strong>  Great, create an account and make sure that you list the courses that you want to teach. Make sure you add the modules and learning outcomes so people understand why they should take this class and how it is different from other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are the advantages for private teachers?</strong>We provide a platform to connect private teachers with groups of people interested to attend classes that the teacher offers. All you need to do as a teacher is to design your program.</p>
    <p> We have optimized the course pages that you create, they will appear on Google searches and increase your chances of getting attendees for your classes</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What does it cost for private teachers or tutors ?</strong> Creating an account on teachera is free but we charge fourty percent or thirty percent on the attendees that have signed up to the class on our platform.
    </p><p> We charge fourty percent if we provide you with a space to conduct your lessons and we charge thirty percent if you organize a place yourself</p>
    <p> We work together with you to ensure that there are enough participants. Classes start if there are three to five students. The class size can also increase to twenty or whatever you can handle.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do I need to register a company to offer classes?</strong> You need to check the requirements at the tax office for the level of revenue that you need to exceed before you need to register a company.</p>
    <p> Teachers are our contractors and not employees. We will demand them to have a private company once they exceed the amount required by the tax offices</p>
